# Quest Mirrorer

Mirrors quests posted to a specific Discord channel, converting them to HTML pages and sending those to a folder of a web server prepared for that purpose.

Uses some code from https://github.com/aubymori/MSPAToGo, hence the GPLv3 license. Uses a discord.py-self, which makes this purely reference code against Discord TOS. Run it at your own risk.
